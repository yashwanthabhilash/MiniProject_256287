### Introduction
..* Hospitals and clinics are the places where our body gets the required maintenance services like the car gets in the garage. If we go with the dictionary, hospital is a health care institution providing patient treatment with specialized medical and nursing staff and medical equipment. 

..* Hospitals and clinics witness a lot of traffic in terms of the incoming and outgoing patients. The job of the management becomes a little easier if the contacts of the patients are well maintained in terms of records. The reason being, it saves a lot of time as the information about a particular patient is just a click away and it also results in saving a lot of paper as records are maintained in soft format rather than the hard format which demands a lot of paper.
