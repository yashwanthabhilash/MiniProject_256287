# Requirements

## Introduction
* Hospitals and clinics are the places where our body gets the required maintenance services like the car gets in the garage. If we go with the dictionary, hospital is a health care institution providing patient treatment with specialized medical and nursing staff and medical equipment. 

* Hospitals and clinics witness a lot of traffic in terms of the incoming and outgoing patients. The job of the management becomes a little easier if the contacts of the patients are well maintained in terms of records. The reason being, it saves a lot of time as the information about a particular patient is just a click away and it also results in saving a lot of paper as records are maintained in soft format rather than the hard format which demands a lot of paper.

## How Hospitals operate?
* A hospital contains one or more wards that house hospital beds for inpatients. It may also have acute services such as an emergency department, operating theatre, and intensive care unit, as well as a range of medical specialty departments. A well-equipped hospital may be classified as a trauma center. They may also have other services such a hospital pharmacy, radiology, pathology and medical laboratories. Some hospitals have outpatient departments such as behavioral health services, dentistry, and rehabilitation services.
